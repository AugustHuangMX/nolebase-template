The game is: **Choose an integer between 0 and 100. The student who guesses the integer which is 1/3 of the average of all the responses rounded up to the nearest integer, wins.**

Consider for the first player 

It is reasonable that the player wouldn't choose any number that is larger than 33.3. (It is dominating all other numbers greater than it, see [[Dominant Strategy]])

And for player 2, she would consider the $\frac{1}{3}$ of the 33, and repeatedly, the only rational answer would be $1$. See [[Iterated Dominance]]
